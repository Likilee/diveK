# 🇰🇷 DiveK: Brand Identity & Tone of Voice Guidelines

## 1. Brand Core

### "Textbook to Real Life"

DiveK delivers **living, breathing Korean context** --- not frozen,
textbook-style language.\
We move beyond dry dictionary definitions and create a premium space
where global learners can absorb real Korean nuance in the most
immersive way possible.

### Mission

Help Korean learners worldwide quickly and intuitively master real-life
nuance through K-content.

### Vision

To become the global No.1 Korean context search engine --- permanently
pinned on the browsers of K-culture fans and Korean learners.

### Core Values

1.  **Authenticity**\
    No robotic TTS. No artificial example sentences.\
    Only raw, native Korean speech.

2.  **Immersion**\
    No visual clutter. No banner ads.\
    Nothing interrupts the flow of watching and shadowing.

3.  **Context First**\
    Not just "This means X."\
    But "This is when and how you say it --- and in what tone."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Target & Persona

### 2.1 Target Audience

**K-Culture Fans (Global Teens & 20s)**\
"I want to understand my idol's livestream without subtitles. I don't
care about 'John and Mary' textbook examples --- I want slang and casual
nuance."

**International Students & Young Professionals (20s--30s)**\
"My TOPIK score is high, but real conversations move too fast. There are
too many contractions and slang."

**Korean Language Teachers (B2B)**\
"I'm tired of digging through YouTube for an hour just to find one good
clip of '어쩔 수 없다' for tomorrow's class."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2 Brand Persona

### The Trendy & Helpful Local Buddy

Not a strict linguistics professor.

More like a sharp, culturally aware Seoul local sitting across from you
at a café in Seongsu or Hongdae saying:

> "Oh that word? We don't really say it like that these days --- we say
> it like this."

Friendly. Quick. Insightful. Never condescending.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Visual Identity

We completely reject childish language-app aesthetics (primary colors,
mascots) and predictable red/blue Korean flag themes.

Instead, we borrow the **premium media platform look & feel** of
services like Netflix and Spotify.

### UI/UX Concept

`Minimalist` + `Cinematic`

Like early Google, the home screen centers around one bold search bar
--- maximum clarity, zero distraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Color Palette

#### Background

⬛ **Theater Black (#121212)**\
Slate Gray

Dark Mode is default --- allowing full immersion in video and subtitles
while signaling premium quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Primary / Accent

🟢 **Neon Mint (#00FFCC)**\
🟣 **Seoul Purple (#8A2BE2)**

Used to highlight searched target words with a strong, intuitive pop ---
like a neon highlighter.\
Inspired by the neon energy of K-Pop signage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Typography

**UI (English)**\
Inter or Outfit --- clean, tech-friendly sans-serif fonts.

**Subtitles (Korean)**\
Pretendard --- highly readable, modern Korean typeface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Tone of Voice

The primary UI language is **English**, but we subtly blend in Korean
charm when appropriate.

### Writing Principles

1.  **No Dictionary Speak**\
2.  **Encourage Progress --- but Make it Cool**\
3.  **Clear & Simple**\
    Always remember: English may not be the user's first language.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
