# DiveK BI Voice Crafting

## Run Voice Workflow

1. Identify the surface.
   - `search-and-results`
   - `empty-or-error`
   - `loading-and-feedback`
   - `tips-tooltips-toast`
   - `upsell-and-retention`
2. Load sources in this order.
   - `docs/DiveK_Brand_Identity_Guidelines_EN.md`
   - `references/voice-patterns.md`
3. Rewrite with three mandatory checks.
   - Remove dictionary/translator tone.
   - Keep encouragement but avoid cheesy hype.
   - Keep grammar simple for non-native English readers.
4. Add subtle Korean charm only when it improves flavor.
5. Return final copy with alternates and rationale.

## Enforce Voice Principles

- Write like a trendy, culturally aware local buddy.
- Keep tone friendly, quick, insightful, and never condescending.
- Keep UI language primarily in English.
- Explain nuance in context, not as sterile definitions.
- Keep copy compact and action-oriented.

## Apply Surface Rules

- Use energetic but readable phrasing for search success.
- Use warm recovery phrasing for no results and errors.
- Use playful motion language for loading states.
- Use coaching-style microcopy for player controls.
- Use premium upsell lines that promise progress, not pressure.

## Return Copy Pack

Use this format:

```markdown
## Voice Craft Output
Surface: loading state
Intent: reassure + maintain immersion

### Primary
Gathering real Korean voices...

### Alternatives
1. Running to Seoul for the best clips...
2. Pulling real-life Korean moments now...

### Why This Works
- Avoids robotic system tone.
- Keeps DiveK's playful and culturally aware personality.
- Stays short for fast comprehension.
